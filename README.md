# 📄 AI-Powered Text Summarization

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI) & NLP (Natural Language Processing)** to summarize long text documents automatically.  
It utilizes **Hugging Face's Transformers** to generate **concise summaries** of large text.

##  Features
-  **Summarizes long text into short, readable summaries.**
-  **Uses a Pre-trained Transformer Model.**
-  **Fast and Efficient NLP Processing.**
-  **Works in Google Colab or locally.**

##  Installation
If running locally, install dependencies with:
```sh
pip install transformers datasets nltk

 How to Use
1️⃣ Open the text_summarization.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2️⃣ Run the notebook cells step by step.
3️⃣ Input any long text, and the model will generate a summary.

 Example
Input:

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals, including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents: any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular applications of AI include language processing, robotics, computer vision, and decision-making systems.

Output Summary:

AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines and is defined as the study of intelligent agents. It is used in NLP, robotics, computer vision, and decision-making.

 Future Enhancements
🤖 Fine-tune the model for specific domains (Medical, Legal, etc.)
🔄 Add an interactive Web UI for summarization
📚 Support for multilingual text summarization
